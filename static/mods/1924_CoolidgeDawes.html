The presidential contender took a break from his campaign schedule to pay a personal visit to a local bull riding session, in which he donned a cowboy hat and rode a bucking bull called “Colonel Corncob” for fourteen seconds before being tossed off by the mighty beast. Local authorities reported that the Secretary of Commerce was not harmed in the accident, and reported it as being “quite fun.”<br><br>Hoover’s ride accompanies a wave of popular sentiment. Across the North bull riding shows become more frequent, and popular, as the sport is increasingly seen as good fun. Campaign chairmen denied however that the Secretary would take up the habit of chewing tobacco or eating biscuits in gravy, increasingly popular recipes.<br><br> An aide to Governor Smith claimed that despite his efforts, Secretary Hoover does not understand the Democratic values of the South. Smith has stumped the South hard in the current campaign, as has Hoover, who seeks to return the South to the two party system for the first time in decades. Smith may believe that Hoover is trying to ride a bucking bull, but the Governor’s Catholic faith indicates Hoover may have a serious chance at cracking the Solid South, which Senator Glass held so strongly.</p>`)
