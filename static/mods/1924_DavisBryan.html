As it turns out, Coolidge was the 'Accidental President'. You will take office in 1925, presiding over economic prosperity.

Goff.<br><br>Soon, the Great Depression will kick in, which will hurt your popularity to a sizable degree. You mull the idea of running for a third term, with straw polling showing you have a chance to win. Nevertheless, you withdraw to help fight the Depression, allowing the 1932 Democratic National Convention to nominate Albert Ritchie, who then loses to Nebraska Senator George Norris in a rout. You continue to endorse Democratic candidates for President, whilst also attempting to appeal to Republicans to take a more firm stance against the rise of Fascism in Europe. Eventually, Norris acquiesces and joins the war against Germany in 1943, before dying shortly after being re-elected. His new running mate, Wendell Willkie, is designated to succeed him, and commits to finishing the war.<br><br>You witness all of this, having retired from public service years ago.
