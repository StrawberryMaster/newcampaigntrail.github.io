Well, for starters, Jimmy Carter wins the 1980 presidential election defeating Ronald Reagan, with the October Surprise being that the Carter administration gets the hostages home  during Operation Desert One about a week before the election. Not to mention, John Anderson wouldn't run in this scenario either.</p><h3>1980</h3><img src='https://i.imgur.com/6TPIihp.png' width='800px'><br><br>The major changes during Carter's second term compared to Reagan's first term would be less intervention in foreign affairs, including no intervention in Nicaragua and Grenada. However, Carter and Mondale would push for more legislation in regards to the environment and social issues, which would largely be successful. However, Jimmy Carter would remain fairly unpopular, and Walter Mondale would be unable to overcome the challenge against Bob Dole. <h3>1984</h3><img src='https://i.imgur.com/uNRyey8.png' width='800px'></a><br><br><h4>Note from Modder</h4><p>This mod has released on Jimmy Carter's 100th birthday, and this mod idea has never been considered until now. I did think about making this mod last year when I started my modding career, but it didn't have a lot of traction because I wasn't so sure that it would be very good. Now that I've built up my mods over the last year, I thought it would be very fitting to get this mod out to you all on October 1, 2024 as a special tribute to Jimmy Carter. I know he's not playable, but it's still a tribute to have a 1984 mod where he's term-limited. Nevertheless, I hope all of you enjoyed my 12th TNCT mod, 1984: Carterverse. There wasn't as much CYOA in this mod as my last mod, 2020: Republican Chaos, but I felt that CYOA wasn't that necessary for this mod. I will be taking a break from modding to focus on school for a bit, but I hope this mod will hold you over until the next mod finishes. As for you President Carter, happy 100th birthday. You are a honorable man that has left a legacy on the United States forever, all starting from a peanut farm in Plains, Georgia. Peanuts Forever!<br><br>-Environmental_Cap104<br><br></p></div>",

Maybe that's what the Republicans need to defeat the liberal Mondale, after it didn't work with a strong conservative like Ronny. Will his efforts be successful? Or will he fall to Fritz? </p>",

Its 24 electoral votes, which Mondale was always favored to grab, could almost guarantee a Dole presidency if you win it. He is a moderate Republican, but that might be what the country needs at this time to move on from the last eight years. He has great skills in prosecution, after he tried and convicted the top aides of the big boss, Richard C. Daley, in a bipartisan manner. Thompson could be a great asset if you want to take a law-and-order approach to your 1984 campaign.</p>",
