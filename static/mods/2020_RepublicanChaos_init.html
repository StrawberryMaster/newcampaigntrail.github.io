Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, President Donald Trump has been impeached and removed from office due to obstruction of Congress and abuse of power, after he solicited the Ukrainian Government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden in order to help his re-election bid in November. <p><p>After Trump was removed, Mike Pence was elevated to the presidency. Little did he know that he'd have to face a global pandemic and social unrest to the likes this country has never seen before. Will his handling of these crises save his presidential career? Or will the sour environment towards Republicans hand Joe Biden the presidency, giving it back to the Democrats? </p>",

The first ever successful Senate impeachment will turn the narrative strongly in favor of the Democrats, on top of Mike Lindell's third-party MAGA candidacy. Not to mention, Pence won't do as well with working-class voters, causing ME-2, Iowa, and Ohio to be more Democratic-leaning here.</a><br><h4>Note from Modder</h4><p>This is my 11th mod, and one where I really experimented with some more hardcore CYOA if you couldn't already tell by playing the mod. Most notably, with the VP switching. This has been a mod concept that I've always wanted to do, and is the first ever mod centered around a presidential impeachment to be released. To those working on a Clinton impeachment 2000 mod, or any other future mods centered around this political process, I hope this mod is one that can be used as an inspiration. Thank you to all who playtested this mod, and gave me feedback on how to make this mod even better. I've actually made many of the changes suggested to me, unlike my last mod. But for now, stay tuned for announcements surrounding my next mod, which like my last few mods, have been teased in one of the endings. So keep playing this mod to find out my next mod before its formal announcement, and to check out some of the other VP's. <br><br>-Environmental_Cap104<br><br></p>",
